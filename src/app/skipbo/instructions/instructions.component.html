<p>
  Shuffle the deck. Each player draws a card. The person with the highest card is the dealer. The dealer deals 30 cards
  to each player if there are two to four players. In five to six player games, each player is dealt 20 cards. These
  cards are dealt face down and form each player’s Stock pile. Once all Stock piles have been dealt, each player flips
  the top card of their Stock pile right side up and places it on top of the pile. The remaining cards not dealt are
  placed face down on the table to form the draw pile.
</p>

<h2>Playing Area</h2>
<p>
  Each player is going to need room for four Discard piles near their Stock pile. You will also need room for four
  Building piles in the center of the table near the draw pile. These piles are formed as the game progresses—so make
  sure you leave space for them.
</p>

<h2>Stock Pile</h2>
<p>The top card is always face up. Each player has a Stock pile.</p>

<h2>Draw Pile</h2>
<p>This is the pile in the center of the playing area created with all cards remaining after Stock piles are dealt.</p>

<h2>Building Piles</h2>
<p>
  Building piles are where players build the 1-12 sequences and can only be started with a 1 or a SKIP-BO (SKIP-BO cards
  are wild, so it would represent a 1 if used to start a sequence). Once a pile has the complete 1-12 sequence, remove
  it from the playing area and start a new building pile. Terrible Game if Your Name is “Bo”
</p>

<h2>Discard Pile</h2>
<p>
  Each player may form sequences an any of their four discard piles. There is no limit to the number of cards in the
  pile, nor is there a restriction on the order. The top card of your discard piles is available for forming sequences
  (can be played).
</p>

<h2>Playing Skip-Bo</h2>
<p>
  Play begins to the left of the dealer. Draw five cards at the beginning of your first turn (and back up to five on
  subsequent turns). You can use a Skip-Bo (wild card) or a 1 to begin one of the four building piles in the center of
  the playing area. You may continue to play cards from your hand onto the building area (1-12 in sequence only). If you
  play all five cards in this manner, draw back up to five (this process can repeat if needed). You may also play the
  top card from your Stock pile onto a building piles, and can continue to play from the Stock pile as long as the play
  is legal. Remember, you win by running out of your Stock pile, so play from there when you can. Your turn ends when
  you can’t or refuse to make a play. Discard one card from your hand onto one of your four discard piles. You may play
  the top card of any of your discard piles on any turn after the first. Play continues clockwise.
</p>

<h2>Winning the Game</h2>
<p>
  Choose a point total to play to (500 is recommended to start). The winner of each round scores 25 points for winning
  the round and five additional points per card remaining in each other player Stock pile.
